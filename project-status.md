## ⏳ Pending Features & Next Steps

### Core Functionality
- **SMS Notifications:** The Twilio integration for sending SMS confirmations is coded but requires `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` to be set in the `.env` file to be fully operational.
- **AI Review Summarizer:** The Genkit flow to summarize reviews is complete. This needs to be integrated into the Facility Detail page (`/facilities/[id]/page.tsx`) so users can generate and see the summary.

### Admin & Owner Portal
- **Dynamic Pricing Application:** The UI for creating dynamic pricing rules exists, but the logic to actually *apply* these rules to the final booking price in `src/lib/utils.ts` is not yet implemented.
- **Promotion Application:** The UI for creating promotion codes exists, but the logic to validate and apply these discounts on the booking confirmation page (`/facilities/[id]/book/page.tsx`) needs to be fully implemented.

### New AI-Powered Features (Planned)
- **AI Image Generation:** The `README.md` mentions a feature for Admins to generate facility images from a text prompt. This would require creating a new Genkit flow (`generate-image-flow.ts`) and integrating it into the `FacilityAdminForm.tsx` component.

### Quality & Polish
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor design tweaks and user experience improvements across the app.
- **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is in place, it could be made more robust in certain areas.
